  title The Conversational Question Answering Challenge

block description
  meta(name='description', content='The Conversational Question Answering (CoQA) Challenge is a new reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage. With 100,000+ question-answer pairs on 500+ articles, SQuAD is significantly larger than previous reading comprehension datasets.')

To do well on SQuAD2.0, systems must not only answer questions when possible, but also determine when no answer is supported by the paragraph and abstain from answering.
                | CoQA is a challenging natural language understanding task for existing models, and we release SQuAD2.0 to the community as the successor to SQuAD1.1. 
                | We are optimistic that this new dataset will encourage the development of reading comprehension systems that know what they don't know.

              p Once you have a built a model that works to your expectations on the dev set, you submit it to get official scores on the dev and a hidden test set. To preserve the integrity of test results, we do not release the test set to the public. Instead, we require you to submit your model so that we can run it on the test set for you. Here's a tutorial walking you through official evaluation of your model:
